** Week 2 feb 2015
*** Things done
 - added some cross-process MCer/MCed communications (socket based)
 - fixed MCer/MCed synchronisation issues
*** Questions
 - MC_automaton_new_propositional_symbol This should probably be
   handled in the MCer but this function exposes a callback function
   for evaluating a symbol. What should we do about this? Kindly ask
   the MCed to execute the function(s) for us?
*** Work Planed [0/1]
**** TODO propert handling of the message on the server side
 - Some message handling is currently stubbed in the MCer.
**** TODO add missing cross-process MCer/MCed communication
 - ask the MCed to continue its execution
 - inform the MCer that a decision point has been reched
**** TODO start moving some MC algorithms to the MCer process
 - Once the basic communication between the MCer/MCed is in place, we can
**** TODO separate source code used by the MCer and the MCed in different files/folders
 - Separing the code in two distinct libraries will ensure that we do not symbols in the wrong process.
